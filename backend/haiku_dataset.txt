New year, new found day
Dawning opportunity
Take time to find joy/
Waking up to dawn
Knowing that the year is new
Happy and hopeful/
My resolution
Dream move rest become
Quiet times my time/
Goals on our minds now
Bring on imaginations
Let passions come forth/
The birth of a year
To live, to love, to nurture
A year to create./
Newness of the day
Bursting forth reassurance
Light follows the dark/
As the light shines,
I am set free. 
Breathe. Release./
Old year New year. Like
bread baking rising, smelling.
Best swallowed while fresh./
New Year Day
everything is in blossom! 
I feel average./
snow covered tree
branches break under pressure
new year/
With ease
one year slips into the next
dancing and singing/
When it is all over
what will begin in its place?
Will it be better?/
Brighten up the day
With memories and smile that is true
When clock stops for thee../
new year visit
3 generations greet me
with the same smile/
New Year morning
the kitchen is crowded
with sisters- in-law/
she tracks lean oxen
with passionate roar, springs―hunts
for a better year/
New Year Day hockey
someone has placed a shovel
across the goal line/
the first day sky:
blue within blue,
wandering thoughts/
waiting for happiness
i hang
a new calendar/
new year day
suddenly i feel myself
so old/
The night celebrates
new star arrival
cracking firework./
Hope is the driving force
most joyful source,
Will show you the right way/
We wish you the best,
regardless what you believe,
good tidings and health!/
December is here.
Everything is ready to go.
Time for the big show./
New Morning Welcome,
twenty-twenty-one
A Year of great things!/
The end of the year.
Some things got done, some did not.
That is why there is next year!/
Be careful walking.
Lurking around the corner.
Children with snowballs/
Phone calls from Strangers,
letters over flow mailbox,
thank you, New Years!/
Holidays over.
Time for the gym and diet.
Too much goose and pie!/
Snowmen don not grow old.
Around for just a season.
But return next year./
Blowing winter snow.
Hot cocoa and marshmallows.
Good book, warm blanket./
One day unites us.
Giftgivers travel the lands.
Peace, love, hope for all!/
A New Year begins
A new chapter, a clean slate…
A chance to re-boot!/
Let us review the good,
Build upon it and improve,
Our hearts be our guides!/
Let us make our dreams of harmony,
Peace, Compassion, Love, Truth, 
Respect, a reality for all!/
The next page blank white
as the next and the one after
filling the whole book/
Turning the page
reading again these poems
for the first time/
Keep knocking, and the joy inside
Will eventually open a window
and look out to see who is there./
A pink smudge
Of dawn signals the new day
The new year./
Janus and Pieces
look both ahead and behind.
The old is made new./
after the downpour
a washed meadow glistening
with shy renewals/
New years day sunshine
brims with anticipation.
Can we hold the joy?/
All night long the wind
buffets against the house
blowing in the new year./
First day of the year.
Wishes ride in on snow flakes
ride out on black slush./
greens and warm chicken
good luck and health for the year
twenty twenty one/
like yesterday
the path still thick with ice
warm new year greetings/
New morning
unmarked calendar
a new life./
New Year beginning,
to share with a genuine
voice of my choosing./
Renewal
Regeneration
Rebirth....Happy New Year!/
Delightful display
Snowdrops bow their pure white heads
To the suns glory./
Let us cheers to us and what we have 
Forget about the bitter half 
Does he like coffee
does he need a little boost
to fly through the night?/
Vintage moulds are used
and some times modern day too
by the Vaillancourts/
For how many years
has Father Christmas roamed here
more than you and me/
Washington Irving
St. Nick might have looked like this
Knickerbocker elf/
It is humid this day
but in four more months we will see
snow and ice and trees/
Heat waves are not fun
especially for the young
waiting his visit/
collectors weekend
the Fezziwigs reception
will have you dancing/
collectors weekend
New Year revels with music
will make spirits bright/
collectors weekend
Bill Wallace is valentine cards

collectors weekend
Bruce Elsass on Halloween

collectors weekend
judis lecture on dickens

collectors weekend
paint your own santa with us
and have a good time/
He went to GiftMart
to see what the new toys are
minimums went up/
wind fingers sore
it is tough to type haikus
every single day/
The good ole days gone
2.2 billion kids now
most of them are good/
Letters keep coming
so many claim to be good
it is a mess to file/
Depression sets in
another day without snow
it is not the same/
Not sure when it came
nor how long it sat outside
that is why he delivers/
Computer went down
can not find any of the SKUs
nature needs a Mac/
Promotion for Mae
She has been here the longest
up, up the ladder!/
Some elves have come back
but a dozen found new work
moved to the big city/
Had lots of coffee
and now there is a long line
children gotta go!/
Easter Bunny came
but this is a New Year blog
so, ho ho ho ho!/
Little Johnny is sad
snow, no where to be found
hes walked the mall twice/
A deep wishing well
is more scary than the lap
to ask for fun toys/
It feels much like Spring
Mrs. tends to the garden
She wants to grow flowers/
For those who follow
our tiny 4 is here!
how can you not want/
It is the last day
A new tiny santa soon
get him while he lasts!/
Had lots of showers
the flowers will grow so strong
can not wait for the snow/
March is almost done
And April will soon be here
Then it is December/
I like New Year presents
Giving to friends and family
Getting is better/
Reindeer can not sing
And elves all have two left feet.
No Holiday Show!/
Better than money
Chalkware piece for your honey
She will think you are sweet/
Deep down in our hearts
There is only one St. Nick
He lives in us all./
Santa took a Fall
But didn not get hurt at all
Jelly Belly saved./
Summer at North pole
Not much different than Winter
A little less snow./
A Spring in his step
A jolly Santa gets prepped
To deliver toys/
In front of the fire
With a warm Winter blanket
Reading Charles Dickens/
He looked down to see
As he sat with his feet up
a hole in his sock/
The Heavenly Choirs 
That sing well each New Year eve
Brings a smile to all/
Brenda Lee did sing
Rocking Around New Year
In the late 1950s/
Crosby The Crooner
Sang White New Year many times
Each time was special/
Bare Naked Ladies
Sing God Rest Ye Gentlemen
In a brand new way/
Bless you, Everyone
From the Lips of tiny Tim
Brings tears to our eyes/
Oranges, brown cloves
decorate the perfect scene
smells and looks so great/
A good Christmas punch
Toasts welcome the season
fellowship complete/
A Gingerbread House
It is baked and decorated
an evening complete/
The holiday fun
Like the Christmas fudge is done
Time to clean the house/
The end of the year
Some things got done, some did not
That is why there is next year!/
Snow keeps coming down
it is mid January
I am ready for Spring/
Presents under tree
And Children are under foot!
Break out the egg nog!/
Christmas carol sung.
Where is my figgy pudding?
Then I can go home./
A Christmas Carol
Scared the Dickens out of me!
Nice person I will be./
Freshly fallen snow
Nice in hills and valleys, but
Not in my driveway/
My first Chalkware piece
Given with Love, Affection!
New tradition born./
Grinch did discover
It is Friends and Family that count
Lessons from Whoville/
Man in the Moon sighs,
How can Santa get to me?
Need plum pudding pies./
A chalkware turkey
Beautiful to see and hold
Don not try to cook it/
New Morning Has Come
Welcome to twonthousand ten
A Year of great things/
Santa likes Korbels
poured glasses for him and hers.
Happy New Years Eve/
Christmas Treasures Bright
To build a small childs delight
On a Christmas night/
Ornaments hung high
to keep from childrens small hands
avoid a clean up/
Stupid reindeer games
Cupid with bow and arrow.
A pain in the butt/
Be careful walking
Lurking around the corner
Children with snowballs/
Had lots of coffee
and now there is a long line
children gotta go!/
Easter Bunny came
but this is a New Year blog
so, ho ho ho ho!/

Pine cones and popcorn
Strung and hung on New Year
Family traditions/
Snowflakes big and small
Fall gently in the forest
spreading white carpet/
Ornaments glisten
hanging on a New Year
catch the light gently/
Candlelight is soft
a fireplace burns for warmth
and hot chocolate soothes/
and have a good time/
